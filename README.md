# HandleWarmer
Heated handlebar tape for the Vieri Gravel rides in beautiful english weather

## Overview
The idea is simple: Put a heating wire (tape) under a handlebar tape and add Power and booom - your handlebar tape will heat up.

The challenge: make sure it doesn't burn and also somehow monitor the temperatur (maybe).

## Functions
### Heating
Self-Explaining
### Monitoring
Measure temperature and power (and also limit it)
### Detection
Detect where the hand is currently located to only heat where it's necessary

## Components
- Heating Wire
- MOSFET to toggle power
- Thermometer (that can be embedded in the tape)
- Handlebar Tape
- Zone Detection

## Considerations
Maybe integrate the hardware into [Redshift Cruise Control Drop Bar Grips](https://redshiftsports.com/products/cruise-control-drop-bar-grips) and [Ergon GC1](https://www.ergonbike.com/en/product-details.html?anr=42410010&s=gc&a=griffe)
